# This file preserves important directory structure for Aura AI
# These directories contain user data and should be preserved locally
# but their contents are excluded from git via .gitignore

# Core data directories that need to exist:
# - aura_chroma_db/     (Vector database storage)
# - aura_data/          (User data, sessions, exports)
# - memvid_data/        (Memory video data)
# - memvid_videos/      (Generated video files)
# - chromadb_backups/   (Database backups)
# - auto_backups/       (Automated system backups)

# Note: This .gitkeep ensures these directories exist after cloning
# while .gitignore prevents their contents from being committed
