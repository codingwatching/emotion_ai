# Phase 03 Validation Strategy

Every plan task has a named automated pytest command and an explicit artifact or human gate. Code-producing tasks use a RED tracer first, the smallest complete GREEN implementation, and refactoring only while green. Real historical stores are outside ordinary task execution: Plans 03-07, 03-08, and 03-09 are non-autonomous gates for fresh inventory, backup/restore, disposable-copy import, and the read switch.

The recorded pre-Phase-3 suite counts differ between current artifacts (`STATE.md` records 510 passed while `03-RESEARCH.md` records 512 passed). Execution must recapture the full non-live baseline; pass/fail and named contract coverage are gates, not a hard-coded pass count.

## Test command contract

All test commands use the locked existing environment:

`uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest ...`

No task may install or sync packages, change `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`, create another environment, or accept a resource-limited/truncated/vacuous result as passing.

## Wave gates

| After wave | Gate command | Required result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests/storage/test_atomic_ledger.py tests/storage/test_idempotency.py tests/storage/test_provenance_supersession.py` | Ledger atomicity/idempotency/provenance all pass |
| 2 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests/storage/test_memory_benchmark.py tests/storage/test_projection_rebuild.py tests/storage/test_storage_owner.py tests/storage/test_legacy_migration.py` | Frozen instrument and projection/migration contracts pass |
| 3 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests/storage/test_hybrid_retrieval.py tests/storage/test_snapshot_restore.py tests/storage/test_export_delete.py tests/storage/test_git_hygiene.py tests/memory/test_prompt_memory_boundary.py tests/memory/test_memvid_archival_safety.py` | Retrieval and lifecycle contracts pass |
| 4 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests -m 'not live'` | Complete existing plus Phase 3 non-live suite passes before real operations |
| 5 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests/storage/test_phase3_evidence.py -k 'proposal or synthetic_readiness or inventory or quiescence or phase1'` | Synthetic proposal passes before metadata approval; approved inventory then passes before separate backup approval |
| 6 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests/storage/test_phase3_evidence.py -k 'backup or restore or migration_plan or authorization_receipt or authorization_summary or phase1'` | Backup/restore/plan and immutable exact-scope receipt pass after human data-read/import/switch approval |
| 7 | `uv run --locked --no-sync python -m pytest -q tests -m 'not live'` | Import/evidence/runtime pass, Ty publishes only the exact SHA to the named safe ref, and its five deterministic jobs are green before final acceptance |

## Human checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Happens after automation | Exact authorization |
|---|---|---|
| 03-07-02 | Exact observation-free proposal and synthetic tool/failure/privacy tests pass | Run metadata-only inventory/preflight against only the listed real paths; no backup or content read |
| 03-07-03 | Approved fresh inventory, writer/handle quiescence, capacity, and Phase 1 hash checks pass | Copy only the listed exact roots to the listed new outside-Git backup target |
| 03-08-02 | Fresh backup parity and isolated restore proof pass | Read/import only new disposable children of the durable backup and switch reads only after all declared gates |
| 03-09-02 | Implementation/evidence commit and synthetic publication parser pass on a clean exact SHA | Ty alone publishes to preferred `phase-03-memory-integrity-ci`, or explicitly selects normal fast-forward `main`/dispatch; tasks only verify read-only |
| 03-09-03 | Publication receipt, migration evidence, full suite, and exact current-commit five-job CI are green | Accept Phase 3 after content-free CI/evidence and local loopback behavior checks |

Authentication failures are dynamic execution gates, not planned setup. No checkpoint authorizes source deletion, old-root repair, archive mutation, retention purge, tracked-data cleanup, Git-history rewrite, graph/RLM, affect salience, frontend redesign, authentication, or an at-rest-encryption claim.

## Nyquist execution rule

For every behavior-adding task:

1. Add the named failing tracer and run its exact command to demonstrate RED.
2. Implement the smallest complete behavior that satisfies the task contract and run the same command to GREEN.
3. Refactor only while that command remains green.
4. Run the wave gate before a dependent wave starts.
5. Preserve exact outputs in the plan summary; a skipped, truncated, resource-limited, empty, or structurally incomplete result is non-pass.

For Plans 03-07 through 03-09, public evidence contains only allowlisted paths/aliases, counts, sizes, timestamps, statuses, HMACed opaque fixture values, and digests. Conversation content, document text, embeddings, raw metadata, and secrets stay in mode-restricted outside-Git attempt artifacts.

## Validation approval

- [x] Every plan task has an automated command.
- [x] Every Phase 3 requirement appears in frontmatter and concrete task coverage.
- [x] Same-wave plans have disjoint `files_modified` sets.
- [x] The sanitized benchmark/instrument is planned before optimization or real-data migration.
- [x] Real data, backup/restore, and read switching are separated by blocking human checkpoints.
- [x] Full Phase 2 behavior is a pre-migration and post-switch gate.
- [x] Final acceptance requires exact current-commit deterministic CI; historical/live/model lanes cannot substitute.
- [x] Only the blocking human-action checkpoint may publish/dispatch the exact SHA; no task auto-pushes or mutates a remote ref.
- [ ] Wave 0/new tracer files exist; they are created RED-first during execution.
- [ ] Human checkpoints complete during execution.

**Approval state:** planned and Nyquist-mapped; execution evidence pending.
